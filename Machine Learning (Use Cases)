1. Spam Email Filter
How it works:
ML algorithms learn to detect spam by analyzing thousands of emails (e.g., words like "FREE" or suspicious links). Over time, it automatically flags junk emails and keeps your inbox clean.

Example:
Gmail uses ML to block spam before it reaches you!

2. Movie/Music Recommendations
How it works:
ML studies what you watch/listen to and suggests similar content. If you love action movies, Netflix/Spotify will recommend more action-packed films or playlists.

Example:
YouTube’s "Recommended for You" section is powered by ML.

3. Facial Recognition in Photos
How it works:
ML scans faces in photos and matches them to people you’ve tagged before. It learns patterns like face shape, eyes, or hairstyle.

Example:
Your phone’s photo gallery uses this to auto-tag friends and family.

4. Predicting House Prices
How it works:
ML analyzes past house sales (size, location, bedrooms) to predict prices of new houses. The more data it gets, the better the predictions.

Example:
Real estate websites like Zillow use ML for price estimates.

5. Voice Assistants (Siri/Alexa)
How it works:
ML converts your voice commands into text, understands what you’re asking, and responds. It learns accents and slang over time.

Example:
When you ask, “Hey Siri, what’s the weather?”, ML helps answer!
